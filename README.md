# VocalKnight

A mod for Hollow Knight v1.5.x that takes speech input and performs in game actions based on predefined keywords. The mod contains 30+ effects and up to 4 potential keywords per effect. Here is the link to the [keyword index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BbaO1pJV2KUgSY1maqH4CtloD41PyoLs0HxU9do1_oc/edit?usp=sharing) which lists all possible effects and their associated triggers. If you plan to stream this content live, I would recommend providing your chatters with command access to the index, with or without first studying it yourself, depending on how stressful you would prefer the initial experience to be.

## System Requirements & Setup

The player must be running the Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating system, as the mod relies on Windows Online Speech Recognition for translating speech into text.

To activate Online Speech Recognition, open your system's Settings app and navigate to Privacy --> Speech. From this page you can turn on the feature. The change is not permanent, and you can deactivate it at any time.

## Required Dependency Mods

The following additional mods are required for the successful operation of VocalKnight:
- Satchel
- SFCore
- Vasi

These can all be installed using [Scarab](https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab).

## Suggested Companion Mods

The following additional mods are highly recommended to be installed and enabled when using VocalKnight:
- Benchwarp
- DebugMod
- QoL

Again, these can all be installed using Scarab.

## Additional Mod Compatibility

The following additional mods are known to be *compatible* with VocalKnight:
- Custom Knight
- MoreSaves
- Randomizer 4

The following additional mods are known to be *incompatible* with VocalKnight:
- HueShifter
- HKTool

## Mod Settings

The mod comes equipped with settings to change the number of potential keywords which may trigger an individual effect (1 to 4 keywords per effect), toggles for enabling and disabling individual effects, and a toggle for the mod itself.

**PLANNED**: A "Randomize" setting which will randomly enable anywhere from 10 to 30 effects and disable the remainder, useful in the event 30+ effects are too overbearing and you as the player would rather leave it up to chance what is active.

## Word of Warning

One of the effects plays music which does not originate from Hollow Knight. The exerpt is from [Funky Dealer by Hideki Naganuma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwE2k0HMDfo), an original track from the SEGA videogame Jet Set Radio Future. AFAIK the song will not trigger a DMCA violation or otherwise create problems for those of you who wish to stream and/or record gameplay with this mod. However, that is still a risk you assume, and I bear no responsibility for what happens. If you are uncomfortable using the track, you can disable the "PARTY" effect in the mod settings.
